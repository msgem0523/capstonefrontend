# 🎨 Capstone Frontend — React + Vite

**Capstone Project** • Frontend Application

This repository contains the **frontend** of my full-stack capstone project. It is built with **React and Vite** and provides the user interface that communicates with a custom backend API.

---

## 🧠 About the Frontend

The frontend is responsible for:

- Rendering the user interface
- Managing client-side state
- Handling user interactions
- Sending requests to the backend API
- Displaying data returned from the server

This app is built with performance and modularity in mind using modern React tooling.
