## Overview  
The **GrowthGuard App** is a full-stack web application designed to help parents track their child's medical history and developmental milestones. Built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**, this app provides an intuitive and secure platform for managing essential pediatric health data.

This repo contains the **frontend** built with React.js, connecting to the backend API for seamless data handling.
